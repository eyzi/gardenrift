# Gardenrift

The goal of this project is to create a small game in Zig, both as a
learning opportunity and a proof-of-concept, to see Zig would be a good
language to stick with for future game development needs.

It would also be a good learning opportunity to learn lower-level
concepts such as graphics and audio APIs, and ECS implementation.
